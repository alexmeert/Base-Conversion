# About the Base Conversion Graphical User Interface

Fundamentals of Computer Systems is a course that relies on being able to quickly and efficiently convert between different bases. I took this as an opportunity to create a basic GUI that would allow me to check my own math on my homework assignments, and to sharpen my python skills. Please let me know how functionality, use, appearance, or efficiency can be improved. Thank you!

# Use

Simply run the **conversion_gui.py** file and enter your decimal, hex, octal, or binary string into the box. This GUI can convert integers and float values in any direction.

Now select the base you are converting from with the respective radio button, as well as the base your are converting to.

# Important Notes

**Binary:** Binary is base 2 and when converting from binary your value should consist of zeros (0) and ones (1)  *(Ex: 1011.0101)*

**Octal:** Octal is base 8 and when converting from octal your value should consist of numbers 1-7  *(Ex: 1342.674)*

**Decimal:** Decimal is base 10 and when converting from decimal your value should consist of numbers 1-10  *(Ex: 1482.936)*

**Hexadecimal:** Hexadecimal is base 16 and when converting from hex your value should consist of numbers 1-10 and letters A-F  *(Ex: 4FDE7.AB6)*
