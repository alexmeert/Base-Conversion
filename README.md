# About the Base Conversion Graphical User Interface

I'm currently taking Fundamentals of Computer Systems, a class that relies on being able to quickly and efficiently convert between different bases. I took this as an opportunity to create a basic GUI that would allow me to check my own handwritten
math on my homework assignments, and to sharpen my python skills. Please let me know how functionality, use, appearance, or efficiency can be improved. Thank you!

# Use

Simply run the **conversion_gui.py** file and enter your integer into the box. This GUI is fairly simple and cannot handle float values currently.

Now select the base you are converting from with the respective radio button, as well as the base your are converting to.
